# F1 Maps
F1 maps is a cross-platform mobile application that is like google maps or apple maps but f1 themed. Featuring a cast of f1 drivers including fan-favorites like Max Verstappen and Lando Norris
while also featuring their cars. Decide between walking or driving to your destination to either be represented by a bobblehead of your beloved drivers, or their cars which win grand prix's etc.

# Frameworks Used
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to build the physical app
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) to generate directions
- [React Native Maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps) to display the MapView
- [Expo Locations](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/location/) to get locations of users
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) to package the app
- Built on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

# How it works
Utilizing React Maps and the native os map application(Apple Maps or Google Maps) to provide accurate location data and live traffic data for optimal routes, the app generates directions to your location, with your location being marked by f1 checkered flags and your icon being your favorite f1 driver or their car, you are now able to explore the world as your favorite drivers
